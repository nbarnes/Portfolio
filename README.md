Overview
========
This project is a custom blogging platform. The live deployment of this
project can be found at http://alightsabermind.com, hosting my blog.

Background
==========
This blogging platform was developed as part of my participation in
the CodeFellows' Ruby on Rails bootcamp during October and November 2013. It
forms a major part of the professional portfolio that I developed during my
time with CodeFellows, showing off my skills with Ruby on Rails and other
technologies used in its development.  It also hosts my tech blog at
http://alightsabermind.com, where I keep my tech blog.

Technology
==========
This application was developed using Ruby on Rails.  Some of the additional
technologies used include HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery, and Twitter
Bootstrap.

Some of the functionality provided by this platform includes user
authentication via Devise, user authorization via Pundit, Markdown formatting
for blog posts via Redcarpet, and unit and functional testing via Minitest
with Capybara.

Continuous integration is done via travis-ci.org, with automatic deployment
for prodution hosting at www.heroku.com
